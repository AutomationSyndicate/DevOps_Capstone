# DevOps_Project

DevOps Project: Java Microservices Deployment with CI/CD & Kubernetes
Objective:
Candidates will develop, containerize, and deploy a Java Spring Boot Microservices Application using open-source DevOps tools. This project focuses on building microservices, automating deployment, monitoring, and managing logs.

Project Scope (2 Weeks)
Tech Stack
Backend: Java (Spring Boot), PostgreSQL
CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions
Containerization: Docker
Orchestration: Kubernetes (Minikube/K3s)
Infrastructure as Code: Terraform
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Week 1: Develop Microservices & CI/CD
Task 1: Develop Java Spring Boot Microservices
Create 2 microservices:
User Service: Manages user accounts (CRUD).
Order Service: Handles order processing.
Use Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and PostgreSQL.
Implement RESTful APIs with Swagger documentation.
Secure APIs using Spring Security + JWT authentication.
Write unit and integration tests (JUnit + Mockito).






Task 2: Containerization with Docker
Write Dockerfiles for each microservice.
Create docker-compose.yml to run services locally.

Task 3: CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins + GitHub Actions)
Automate the following using Jenkins and GitHub Actions:
Build & Test: Run tests on every push.
Containerization: Build and push Docker images to Docker Hub.
Deployment: Deploy services to Kubernetes using Helm.

Week 2: Deployment & Monitoring
Task 4: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
Use Terraform to provision a VM on AWS/Azure/GCP.
Install Kubernetes (K3s/Minikube) on the VM.

Task 5: Deploy Microservices on Kubernetes
Write Kubernetes manifests (deployment.yaml, service.yaml) for each service.
Set up PostgreSQL as a StatefulSet in Kubernetes.
Implement Service Discovery using Kubernetes Services.
Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA).

Task 6: Monitoring & Logging
Deploy Prometheus + Grafana to monitor API performance.
Set up ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.






Deliverables
âœ… GitHub Repository with microservices source code
âœ… CI/CD pipeline scripts (Jenkins file + GitHub Actions YAML)
âœ… Docker & Kubernetes manifests
âœ… Terraform scripts
âœ… Monitoring dashboards (screenshots or live link)

Stretch Goals (Bonus)
ðŸš€ Implement API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway) for routing.
ðŸš€ Set up Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j/Hystrix) for fault tolerance.
ðŸš€ Use Kafka/RabbitMQ for inter-service communication.

Outcome
This project ensures candidates understand microservices, containerization, automation, and monitoringâ€”key DevOps skills!
